# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Project5-dlnd-face-recognition
Used generative adversarial networks(GAN) to generate new images of faces. Built a GAN using convolutional layers in the generator and discriminator (Deep Convolutional GAN, or DCGAN). Used batch normalization to get the convolutional networks to train.
